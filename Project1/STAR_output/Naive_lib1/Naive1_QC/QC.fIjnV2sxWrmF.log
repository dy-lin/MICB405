        minPhredScore:            2
NOTE: Read length is not consistent.
   In the first 10000 reads, read length varies from 30 to 75 (param maxReadLength=75)
Note that using data that is hard-clipped prior to alignment is NOT recommended, because this makes it difficult (or impossible) to determine the sequencer read-cycle of each nucleotide base. This may obfuscate cycle-specific artifacts, trends, or errors, the detection of which is one of the primary purposes of QoRTs!In addition, hard clipping (whether before or after alignment) removes quality score data, and thus quality score metrics may be misleadingly optimistic. A MUCH preferable method of removing undesired sequence is to replace such sequence with N's, which preserves the quality score and the sequencer cycle information.
   WARNING WARNING WARNING: Read length is not consistent, AND "--maxReadLength" option is not set!
      QoRTs has ATTEMPTED to determine the maximum read length (75).
      It is STRONGLY recommended that you use the --maxReadLength option 
      to set the maximum possible read length, or else errors may occur if/when 
      reads longer than 75 appear.
   Note: Data appears to be paired-ended.
   Sorting Note: Reads are not sorted by name (This is OK).
   Sorting Note: Reads are sorted by position (This is OK).
Done checking first 10000 reads. WARNINGS FOUND!
